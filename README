# usernamer
usernamer is a penetration testing tool to generate a list of possible usernames/logins for determined name (ex: John Doe Doeson) for user enumeration or bruteforcing. 
This tool also supports text-files with one name per line as input.

usernamer has a plugin structure that enables a series of transformations:
* normal: Permutates given name with all surnames (if more than one) with name starting and ending (johndoedoeson,johndoesondoe,doedoesonjohn etc)
* two_terms: Permutates given name with all surnames (if more than one) with name starting and ending but it will output a two-termed login (johndoe, doejohn, johndoeson etc)
* one_term: Permutates all name tokens (first name and surnames) and generates single terms usernames (john, doe, doeson)
* dotted_two_terms: Permutates given name with all surnames (if more than one) with name starting and ending but it will output a two-termed login dot-separated (john.doe, doe.john, john.doeson etc)
* normal_abbreviated: Generates abbreviated versions of the 'normal' and 'two_terms' plugins (jdoe, johnd, jd etc)
